## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to establish a structured process for reviewing and updating documentation every two weeks to ensure accuracy, relevance, and clarity.

| Documentation Owner / Project Manager | Ensure that documentation is reviewed, updated, and approved. |

## Review Schedule

Reviews are done every two weeks, after the meeting with the customer. 

Review date is specified as the day the customer meeting is on. 

Allowed delay is the number of days before the next mentor meeting.

## Review Process
### Preparation (Before Review)

The Documentation Owner compiles a list of outdated documents or those that require a review based on:

- Recent changes in the project source code.
- New or updated customer requirements.
- Mentor feedback.

Team members are notified about which documents they have to review.

### Review Session

Each team member reviews documentation on their own. After completion, updated documentation is uploaded in the project repository.

Clarity and usability is assessed by the Project Manager.

### Post-Review Actions

A summary of changes is shared in the teamâ€™s telegram chat.

Any changes made are presented to the mentor during the next meeting.
