Consider each member's weekly available development time.

Note: Table may change in the future

| Yaroslav | 12                                | Management/Documentation |
| Akam     | 12                                | Database                 |
| Vagif    | 12                                | Server and network logic |
| Kirill   | 12                                | LLMs                     |

Hopefully, every developer can provide all 12 hours every week. Plan for that, change things up if that does not happen due to Acts Of God. 

Next, multiply the time each developer can provide by the amount of weeks left and compare it against all outstanding issues.

When we are on time (There is up to 1 free hour on each developer per week), continue functions as usual

When we are ahead of time (There is more than 1 free hour on each developer per week), allocate more issues per developer

When we are not on time (There are no free hours on each developer per week), consider:
- Source more work-hours from developers
- Postpone issues that are considered non-essential
