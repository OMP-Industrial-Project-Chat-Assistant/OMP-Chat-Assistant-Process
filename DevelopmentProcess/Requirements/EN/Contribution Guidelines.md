## Branch Naming Convention <a name="branch-naming-convention"></a>

### Format
Non-release branches must follow this naming structure:  
`<type>/chat-<issue-number>/<short-description>`

- **`<type>`**: Either `feature` (for new functionality) or `bug` (for bug fixes).
- **`chat-<issue-number>`**: The GitHub issue number prefixed with `chat-` (e.g., `chat-42`).
- **`<short-description>`**: A brief, hyphen-separated description of the task (e.g., `add-message-timestamp`).

Release branches must follow this naming structure:
`release/<version>`

### Examples
- `feature/chat-45/add-file-upload`
- `bug/chat-12/fix-message-duplication`
- `release/1.0`

### Rules
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens (no spaces or underscores).
- Keep descriptions concise (3â€“5 words).

---

## Assigning Branches to Issues <a name="assigning-branches-to-issues"></a>

1. **Link Branches to Issues**  
   - Add a comment to the issue with a link to the branch (e.g., `Working on this in [branch-name]`)
   - Add the branch in the Development category of sidebar on the right of the issue preview
---

## Creating Pull Requests <a name="creating-pull-requests"></a>

### Timing
- **Before the wrap-up meeting**: Create a PR targeting the **latest release branch** (e.g., `release/1.2.0`).  
- Ensure PRs are created early enough for review and discussion.

### Steps
1. **Push Changes**  
   Commit and push your branch to the remote repository.
2. **Create a PR**  
   - Base branch: Latest release branch (e.g., `release/1.2.0`).  
   - Compare branch: Your feature/bug branch.  
3. **PR Description**  
   - Use the [Pull Request Template](#pull-request-template) (see below).  
   - Include screenshots, testing steps, and a link to the issue.  
4. **Assign Reviewers**  
   Tag relevant team members for code review.

## Merging and Cleanup <a name="merging-and-cleanup"></a>

### After Approval
1. **Merge into Release Branch**  
2. **Delete the Branch**  
   - Check the "Delete branch" option in GitHub after merging.  
   - Confirm deletion locally:  
     ```bash
     git branch -d <branch-name>
     git fetch --prune
     ```
3. **Close the Issue**  

---

## Best Practices <a name="best-practices"></a>

1. **Sync with Release Branch**  
   Regularly rebase your branch with the latest release branch to avoid conflicts:  
   ```bash
   git checkout release/[latest-version]
   git pull
   git checkout your-branch
   git rebase release/[latest-version]
   ```
2. **Small, Focused PRs**  
   Keep PRs small and limited to one feature/bug fix.  
3. **Test Locally**  
   Verify functionality and ensure no regressions before creating a PR.
