## Customer feedback on demo  
**What was the customer feedback on the demo?**  
- No explicit feedback on a demo was mentioned in the document.  

## New requirements  
**What new requirements were elicited?**  
- Develop a **chatbot API** that:  
  - Answers questions about Aurora documentation **in Russian**.  
  - Always provides links to relevant documentation and code snippets.  
  - Strictly limits answers to Auroraâ€™s scope (avoids out-of-context responses).  
  - Can be **deployed independently** from their main portal (supports custom documentation/content).  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Must use **open-source solutions** only (with prior approval to ensure license compatibility).  
  - Must **not rely on external resources** during operation (self-contained system).  

## New requests  
**What future artifacts did the customer request?**  
- Hardware requirements specification if borrowing a server is needed.  
- Confirmation of internship details (to be finalized by end of February).  

**What we requested from the customer?**  
- Access to Aurora documentation and code snippet repositories (to be provided in a few days).
